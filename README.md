Verilog AI-DSP design + C++ Experimental Toolchain Design Project

> This repository contains a complete experimental toolchain that integrates a custom-designed DSP hardware core (in Verilog) with a compiler backend (in C++) for AI model scheduling and execution. It is designed as an end-to-end platform to explore how AI workloads can be lowered and executed efficiently on lightweight DSP architectures.
